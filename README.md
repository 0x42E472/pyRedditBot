# pyRedditBot
Simple python script making use of Reddit's PRAW module. Works like a standard bot that can easily be modified to post what you want under what you want. Needs to be setup using Reddits API rules (https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API).

Things to do:
    1. Fix bugs
    2. Optional logging
    3. Replying to replies (and replies of replies and so on)
